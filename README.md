Welcome to my GitHub 🏌️‍♂️💻

Who am I?

I’m a data scientist who somehow ended up here after a psychology degree—so yes, I can probably predict your next move… or at least overfit to it.

When I’m not debugging code, I’m debugging my golf swing, optimizing both machine learning models and my short game (both are a work in progress).

What I Do 🧠📊
- Python, SQL, and R (R is holding on by a thread, C is already in therapy).
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (because why manually decide when an AI can hallucinate for me?).
- Data Science (turning coffee into code, and code into mildly useful insights).
- Decision-Making & Behavioral Science (figuring out why people do what they do, including myself when I push to main at 3 AM).

Fun Facts 🎉
- I write clean code… until I don’t.
- I believe in reproducibility—except in golf, where every shot is a surprise.
- I don’t always comment my code, but when I do, I confuse even myself.
- I love math, but math doesn’t always love me back.
